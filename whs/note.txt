This is for setting up a site with the help of Cert-Bot with preconfigured settings for the nginx unit, nginx server blocks, and wordpress.


For renewing your certbot ssl certificate, schedule a cron job (i made it for every month, technically just the first day of every moth):

$ crontab -e 

0 0 1 * * sudo certbot renew
