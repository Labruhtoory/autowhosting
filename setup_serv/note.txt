This is for setting up a site with the help of Cert-Bot
The only things to pay attention to are http2 and renewing your certificate.

In ur nginx server config file, enable http2 by finding:

listen 443 ssl;

and changing to:

listen 443 ssl http2;


For renewing your certificate, schedule a cron job (i made it for every month, technically just the first day of every moth):

crontab -e 

0 0 1 * * sudo certbot renew
